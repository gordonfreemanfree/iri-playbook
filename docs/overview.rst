For the fully automated installation visit :ref:`getting_started_quickly`.

The `git repository <https://github.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook>`_ includes all the code of the automated installation using Ansibe Playbook.

The automated installed installs IRI and IOTA peer manager, a web GUI with which you can view your neighbors, add or remove neighbors, view the sync and much more.

In addition, it will install IOTA node monitoring/graphs (grafana).
