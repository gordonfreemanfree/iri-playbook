Installation
************

**WARNING**: The **recommended** way to install the node is using the :ref:`getting_started_quickly`!!!

The following documentation is provided as reference for those with good experience with Linux and Ansible, or for those who would like to **install multiple nodes at once**.

If you are about to install **multiple nodes at once**, you can use one of the nodes as the node from which you will be running the IRI playbook. All the information below should be executed on this node only.


Update System Packages
======================

To prepare for running the automated "playbook" from this repository you require some basic packages, as shown below.

For **Ubuntu/Debian** we type:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt update -qqy --fix-missing -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove -y --purge

and for **CentOS**:

.. code-block:: bash

   yum update -y


This will search for any packages to update on the system and require you to confirm the update.

Centos Selinux
--------------
For CentOS the playbook requires (for security enhancement) that Selinux is enabled. Please edit the file ``/etc/selinux/config`` and make sure the line with ``SELINUX=`` is set to ``enforcing``:

.. code:: bash

  SELINUX=enforcing

If you had to edit the file to set it to enforcing, you'll have to restart the server using the command ``reboot``.

Reboot Required?
----------------

Sometimes it is required to reboot the system after package updates (e.g. kernel updated). You can skip this test if you have already restarted the server in the prebious step to enable Selinux for CentOS.


Ubuntu and Debian
+++++++++++++++++
For **Ubuntu/Debian** we can check if a reboot is required. Issue the command ``ls -l /var/run/reboot-required``::

  # ls -l /var/run/reboot-required
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32 Dec  8 10:09 /var/run/reboot-required


If the file is found as seen here, you can issue a reboot (``shutdown -r now`` or simply ``reboot``).

Centos
++++++
For **Centos** we have a few options how to check if a reboot is required.

One of these options requires to install ``yum-utils``::

  yum install yum-utils -y

Once installed, we can run ``needs-restarting  -r``::

  # needs-restarting  -r
  Core libraries or services have been updated:
    systemd -> 219-42.el7_4.4
    glibc -> 2.17-196.el7_4.2
    linux-firmware -> 20170606-56.gitc990aae.el7
    gnutls -> 3.3.26-9.el7
    glibc -> 2.17-196.el7_4.2
    kernel -> 3.10.0-693.11.1.el7

  Reboot is required to ensure that your system benefits from these updates.

As you can see, a reboot is required (do so by issuing a ``reboot`` or ``shutdown -r now``)


Installing Ansible
==================
Ansible is an awesome software used to automate configuration and/or deployment of services.
This repository contains what Ansible refers to as a "Playbook" which is a set of instructions on how to configure the system.

This playbook installs required dependencies, the IOTA IRI package and IOTA Peer Manager.
In addition, it configures firewalls and places some handy files for us to control these services.

To install Ansible on **Ubuntu** please refer to the `official documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt
-ubuntu>`_

To install Ansible on **Debian** please refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-debian>`_

Hereby a one-liner to install Ansible on **Ubuntu**:

.. code:: bash

   apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get clean && apt-get update -y && apt-get install software-properties-common -y && apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible -y && apt-get update -y && apt-get install ansible git nano -y


For **CentOS**, first install epel-release:

.. code:: bash

  yum install epel-release -y

Then Ansible and some extra packages:

.. code:: bash

  yum install ansible git nano -y

You will notice I've added 'git' which is required (at least on CentOS it doesn't have it pre-installed as in Ubuntu).
In addition, I've added 'nano' which is helpful for beginners to edit files with (use vi or vim if you are adventurous).

.. note::

  See :ref:`usingNano` for instructions on how to use ``nano``.


Cloning the Repository
======================
In this step we're going to clone the ``feat/docker`` branch of the iri-playbook repository:

.. code:: bash

   cd /opt && git clone -b "feat/docker" https://github.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook.git && cd iri-playbook

This will pull the repository to the directory in which you are and move you into the repository's directory.

If you need to change to a specific branch (e.g. to test a new feature), for example to a branch called ``feat/docker-dev`` you can run:

.. code:: bash

  git checkout feat/docker-dev



Configuring Values
==================

Here is some general information about configuring installation options in variable files. You can skip this information and proceed with the next sections for default configuration.

The directory containing all variable files are in ``group_vars/all/*.yml``. You will find some configuration parameters for the installation in those files.

**Please don't edit those files directly** but copy the files to ``group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml`` (depending on the name of the original file) and edit the options there. This will effectively override existing variables from other files. Hence the usage of ``z-`` as the files get loaded in an alphabetic order, it ensures the variables will be overridden.


.. note::

  To edit files you can use ``nano`` which is a simple editor. See :ref:`usingNano` for instructions.


Set Access Password
-------------------

This user name and password are used for all web-based authentications (e.g. Peer Manager, Monitoring Graphs).

If you haven't done so already, create a new variable file called **group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml** and set a user and a (strong!) password of your choice:

.. code:: bash

  fullnode_user: someuser
  fullnode_user_password: 'put-a-strong-password-here'

Make sure to restrict access to the password file:

.. code:: bash

  chmod 600 group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml  


**NOTE:** This username and password will also be used for Grafana (monitoring graphs)



Extra Configuration Options
---------------------------

Some extra configuration options can be specified, for example:

Ensure Docker is installed:

.. code:: bash

  echo "install_docker: true" >>/opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml

Ensure nginx is installed:

.. code:: bash

  echo "install_nginx: true" >>/opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml


Ensure HAProxy is enabled:

.. code:: bash

  echo "lb_bind_address: 0.0.0.0" >>/opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml

Enable memory auto-configuration:

.. code:: bash

  echo "memory_autoset: True" >>/opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml



.. _multipleHosts:

Configure Multiple Fullnodes
----------------------------

You can skip this section and proceed to "Running the Playbook" below if you are only installing a single server.

The nice thing about Ansible's playbooks is the ability to configure multiple nodes at once. You can have hundreds of fullnodes installed simultaneously!

You pick one of the nodes and use it as the "main" installer node. That is where the installer will run from and configure all the rest of the nodes.

Please make sure you configure some options as shown above into the variable override file.

To configure **multiple hosts** you need to set their IP addresses or hostnames (hostnames must resolve to their respective IP). For the node from which you are going to run the playbook, you will have to remove the line begining with ``localhost`` and use the node's hostname or IP address. If you need to explicitly set the ip addres of the node for use by the playbook you can add ``ip=ip-address-here`` next to the hostname or IP of the node (this is used in the playbook to configure firewall access between the nodes).

Edit the file ``inventory`` or create a new inventory file e.g. ``inventory-multi`` (you will have to point ansible-playbook to the correct file once you run the playbook using the `-i` option and the filename, e.g.: ``-i inventory-multi``).

Here's an example of how we would list four hosts, using hostname and/or IP::

  [fullnode]
  iota01.tangle.io ansible_user=john ip=10.20.30.40
  iota02.tangle.io ansible_user=root ip=10.30.40.50
  10.20.30.40      ansible_ssh_port=9922

  [fullnode:vars]
  # Only add this line for Ubuntu and Debian
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
  # Only set this line if you didn't ssh to the servers previously
  # from the node where you are about to run the playbook from:
  ansible_ssh_common_args='-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'


At this stage management of multiple nodes is not centralized. You'll have to manage each node separately (downloading a fully synced database, configuring neighbors etc).


Running the Playbook
====================

By default, the playbook will run locally on the server where you've cloned it to.

If you are installing on several nodes at once, you can copy ``inventory-multi.example`` to ``inventory-mutli`` and makes sure to refernce this file on the command below instead of the default ``inventory`` when running the playbook.

This will run the installer on a **single node**:

.. code:: bash

   ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -v

This will run the installer for **multiple nodes**:

.. code:: bash

   ansible-playbook -i inventory-multi site.yml -v


This can take a while as it has to install packages, download IRI and compile it.
Hopefully this succeeds without any errors (create a git Issue if it does, I will try to help).


Final Steps
-----------

Please go over the :ref:`post_installation` chapters to verify everything is working properly and start adding your first neighbors!

Also note that after having added neighbors, it might take some time to fully sync the node, or read below the "Fully Synchronized Database Download" section.

If you installed `monitoring` and `IOTA Peer Manager` you should be able to access those (ignore the warning about invalid certificates)::

  Peer Manager: https://your-external-ip:8811
  Grafana: https://your-external-ip:5555

Use the username and password from ``group_vars/all/z-iri-override.yml`` if you set it there previously.

If you followed the Getting Started Quickly guide, you've configured a username and password during the installation.
